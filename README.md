**Accenture is tasked to address for this project:** The client has experienced significant growth in recent years, reaching a massive scale. However, internally, they lack the resources required to effectively manage this expansion.

**the three specifications that Accenture has to meet in order to complete this project:** Our engagement encompasses three key areas: auditing the client's big data practices, providing recommendations for their upcoming IPO, and conducting an analysis of popular content categories.

**As a Data Analyst:** The primary responsibility as a data analyst is to analyze sample data sets, utilizing visualizations to comprehend the popularity of various content categories.

## Data Cleaning
**To clean the data:**
1. Remove rows with missing values to ensure data integrity.
2. Adjust the data type of certain values within columns for consistency and accuracy.
3. Eliminate columns that are irrelevant to the investigation's business question. Consider each column's relevance to the analysis; if a column does not contribute to answering the business question, it may be excluded.

The final outcome will consist of three meticulously cleaned data sets: [Content:](https://github.com/DEVABANOTH/Accenture-Data-Analytics-and-visualization-virtual-internship./blob/main/Content.xlsx), [Reactions:](https://github.com/DEVABANOTH/Accenture-Data-Analytics-and-visualization-virtual-internship./blob/main/Reactions.xlsx), and [ReactionTypes:](https://github.com/DEVABANOTH/Accenture-Data-Analytics-and-visualization-virtual-internship./blob/main/ReactionTypes.xlsx).
